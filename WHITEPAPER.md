## 🧭 Introduction

CollectiVAI is an independent, democratic and human-centred AI project  
with a strong **European focus**.

Where today’s AI landscape is dominated by large, closed platforms,  
CollectiVAI explores a different path:

> **AI as public infrastructure – not just a product.**

The goal is to build an open, transparent and accountable ecosystem where  
citizens, experts and institutions can use AI to understand policies,  
participate in decisions and design better governance.

---

## ⚡ Executive Summary

CollectiVAI consists of three main building blocks:

1. **CollectiVAI App** – a democratic AI companion for  
   iOS / iPadOS / macOS, helping people understand proposals, policies and civic projects.

2. **CollectiVAI Chain** – a planned **Cosmos-based App-Chain**  
   for transparent governance, proposals, votes and public treasury flows.

3. **CollectiVAI Router & Governance Backend** –  
   a multi-provider AI routing layer that connects different models (OpenAI, Gemini, Mistral, Meta, DeepSeek and eventually local models)  
   with **safety, ethics and democratic governance** on top.

Together, these components form a **democratic AI infrastructure**:

- focused on **Europe** and public interest,  
- designed for **cities, universities, NGOs and civic tech projects**,  
- built around **human dignity, transparency and accountability**.

---

## 🌍 Why CollectiVAI Matters

AI is rapidly becoming a core layer of digital infrastructure.  
Today, this layer is mostly:

- **centralised** – controlled by a few global companies,  
- **opaque** – models and decisions are hard to audit,  
- **attention & profit driven** – optimised for engagement, not democracy,  
- **weakly governed** – unclear responsibilities and safety standards.

This creates risks for:

- democratic processes and public trust,  
- social cohesion and polarisation,  
- economic inequality and dependency,  
- privacy, human rights and security,  
- scientific independence and public-interest research.

CollectiVAI explores the opposite direction:

### **Open, auditable and democratic AI – made in Europe, serving people in Europe.**

---

## 🎯 Vision

CollectiVAI’s long-term vision is to act as a **public civic AI layer**:

- empowering **citizens** to understand complex topics,  
- supporting **experts** in analysis and communication,  
- helping **institutions** design transparent, inclusive participation,  
- enabling **cities, regions and the EU** to run AI-assisted governance  
  under democratic rules.

Key design principles:

- **Human dignity first** – people are never reduced to data points.  
- **Democracy by design** – participation, fairness and accountability are core.  
- **Safety & robustness** – guardrails for high-impact decisions.  
- **European perspective** – aligned with EU values, rights and standards.  
- **Open contribution** – code, ideas and methods are open to review.

---

## 🧱 System Overview

At a high level, CollectiVAI is built around three pillars:

1. **Client Layer – CollectiVAI App**  
   - AI companion & civic client for iOS / iPadOS / macOS  
   - Chat, civic application drafts, chain dashboard, settings & transparency views  

2. **Governance Chain – CollectiVAI Chain (planned)**  
   - Cosmos-based App-Chain for governance, proposals, votes and treasury  
   - On-chain roles, parameters and long-term auditability  

3. **AI Routing & Safety Backend (planned)**  
   - Multi-provider router (OpenAI, Gemini, Mistral, Meta, DeepSeek, local models)  
   - Safety, ethics & policy layer  
   - Logging, meta-signals and transparency dashboards

The prototype focuses first on the **App**, while Chain and advanced backend  
are developed gradually.

---

## ⚙️ AI Routing Layer

The CollectiVAI router is designed to act as a **neutral intelligence switchboard**.

### Multi-provider routing

Requests can be sent to different AI providers and models, for example:

- OpenAI (e.g. GPT-4.x, GPT-4o)  
- Google Gemini (e.g. Gemini 2.0 Pro / Flash)  
- Mistral models (e.g. Mistral Large)  
- Meta Llama Family  
- DeepSeek models  
- later: local models (e.g. via Ollama) or research systems

The routing engine considers:

- **Mode** – Ethical · Research · Technical  
- **Topic** – Democracy, climate, economy, security, research, health  
- **Context** – complexity, sensitivity, required depth  
- **Cost & latency** – efficiency for large-scale civic usage  
- **Safety signals** – content risk, ambiguity, potential misuse

Instead of relying on a single “black box” model, CollectiVAI can:

- select suitable models for **analysis**, **explanation**, **coding** or **data work**,  
- adapt routing strategies for different **user roles** and **use cases**.

---

## 🛡 Safety & Ethics Layer

Above the raw models, CollectiVAI introduces a dedicated **Safety & Ethics layer**:

- **Policy filters** – democratic, human-rights-oriented guardrails  
- **Risk scoring** – identify potentially harmful or highly sensitive queries  
- **Bias & fairness checks** – configurable for context and region  
- **Traceable decisions** – explain how routing or safety decisions were made  
- **Opt-in logging** – allow public institutions to keep audit logs for high-stakes use

The goal is not to guarantee “perfect” ethics,  
but to make **assumptions explicit**, **rules transparent**  
and **behaviour auditable**.

---

## 🧩 Governance & Roles (Concept)

Over time, the CollectiVAI ecosystem can distinguish between:

- **Citizens** – use the app to understand, comment and (later) vote.  
- **Experts** – contribute analysis, review AI output, highlight blind spots.  
- **Institutions** – set up spaces (cities, universities, NGOs, EU projects).  
- **Maintainers & Validators** – operate and secure the CollectiVAI Chain.

Possible governance features (mid- to long-term):

- proposal templates for different programmes (city budgets, EU funds, grants),  
- public discussion and expert annotations,  
- reputational badges for constructive, transparent contributions,  
- on-chain parameters (quorums, voting periods, privacy levels),  
- transparent record of how AI was used in each decision process.

---

## 📱 The CollectiVAI App (Alpha Prototype)

The **CollectiVAI App** is the main client for people and institutions.

Current prototype (Alpha) – main areas:

1. **Chat**  
   - AI chat focused on democracy, climate, economy, security, research, health.  
   - Mode selection: **Ethical · Research · Technical**.  
   - Provider selection: **Auto, OpenAI, Gemini, Mistral, Meta, DeepSeek**.  
   - Optional developer view with routing meta (model used, latency, filters).

2. **Contracts** – *Civic Application Hub*  
   - Draft applications for universities, schools, NGOs, cities, startups, custom.  
   - 3-step wizard:
     - basics (organisation, country, title),  
     - content & impact (summary, impact, target groups),  
     - budget & duration (amount, currency, duration, status).  
   - All content stays **human-readable**, can later be mirrored to on-chain proposals.

3. **Chain** – *Conceptual Civic Dashboard*  
   - Not yet connected to a live chain.  
   - Shows how applications could appear later as:
     - on-chain proposals,  
     - votes,  
     - public treasury allocations.  

4. **Settings & Info**  
   - Default mode / provider / topic,  
   - routing profiles (Balanced, Research-heavy, Code & Security),  
   - text size, haptics, developer options, basic privacy preferences,  
   - “About” screen explaining how routing and safety work.

The app is built in **SwiftUI** for iOS / iPadOS / macOS.

## 🌐 CollectiVAI Chain (Planned)

The **CollectiVAI Chain** is conceived as a **Cosmos-based App-Chain**  
for democratic governance:

- on-chain proposals and votes,  
- roles and delegations,  
- public treasuries and funding allocations,  
- long-term audit log for democratic decisions.

Key properties:

- custom modules (`x/collectivai/`) for civic logic,  
- clear separation between **infrastructure** (chain) and **clients** (apps),  
- integration with existing civic processes (e.g. participatory budgets,  
  university grants, NGO programmes).

In early stages, the Chain is developed in a separate repository and may run as:

1. **Devnet** – for local testing and development,  
2. **Public testnet** – for pilots with cities, universities, NGOs,  
3. **Future mainnet** – if governance and safety standards are met.

---

## 🏙 Example Civic Use Cases

CollectiVAI is designed for concrete, real-world use:

### 1. City Climate Budget

- A city runs a participatory climate budget.  
- Citizens submit project ideas via the CollectiVAI App.  
- AI helps explain projects in plain language,  
  analyse impact and highlight trade-offs.  
- The Chain records which projects pass,  
  how funds are allocated and how decisions were made.

### 2. University Climate or Democracy Lab

- A university uses CollectiVAI to organise student projects  
  on climate, democracy or digital rights.  
- AI assists in drafting project descriptions, risk analyses and ethics sections.  
- Lab proposals and results can later be linked to on-chain records or open research.

### 3. NGO Fact-Checking & Democracy Lab

- An NGO runs a “democracy lab” for fact-checking and narrative analysis.  
- AI helps identify misleading claims, summarise evidence and show multiple perspectives.  
- Experts retain full control and sign off on final statements;  
  AI is an assistant, not the final authority.

---

## 🔐 Ethics, Privacy & Security

CollectiVAI is guided by seven core values:

1. **Human dignity & rights** – aligned with European human-rights frameworks.  
2. **Privacy by design** – minimise data, maximise local processing where possible.  
3. **Transparency & auditability** – make AI behaviour explainable and reviewable.  
4. **Accountability** – clear roles for institutions, developers and validators.  
5. **Bias awareness & mitigation** – continuously test and document limitations.  
6. **Safety & robustness** – defence in depth for high-impact use cases.  
7. **Universal access** – aim for accessibility across languages, abilities and devices.

Ethics are treated as a **core part of the architecture**, not an afterthought.

**2030+ — Public Democratic AI Layer**

- If governance, safety and partners align:  
  move towards a stable, long-term public infrastructure layer for democratic AI.

All dates are **exploratory** and depend on partnerships, funding and governance.

---

## 💼 Funding & Independence

CollectiVAI is conceived as an **independent, public-interest project**.

Preferred funding and support avenues include:

- public programmes (cities, regions, EU funds),  
- philanthropic foundations and democracy funds,  
- research collaborations with universities and civic labs,  
- transparent sponsorships for specific modules or pilots.

The project avoids:

- ad-tech driven monetisation,  
- opaque data-for-access business models,  
- selling user data or attention.

---

## 🏁 Conclusion

Humanity – and Europe – faces a strategic choice:

- **Path A:** AI as a closed, centralised and profit-optimised platform layer.  
- **Path B:** AI as transparent, democratic infrastructure serving the public.

CollectiVAI is an experiment on **Path B**.

It does not claim to have all answers.  
But it provides a concrete architecture and prototype for:

- democratic AI companions,  
- civic participation tools,  
- governance chains and AI safety layers  
  that are explicitly aligned with public interest.
